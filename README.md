## 💡 TIPS & TRICKS

### Rivals Tips

1. **Master the Parry**: Auto-parry is powerful, but manual parrying with good timing is still best
2. **Use Prediction**: Adjust prediction based on enemy movement patterns
3. **FOV Sweet Spot**: 100-150 FOV is usually optimal
4. **Smooth Aim**: Higher smoothing = more legit looking
5. **Hitbox Size**: 10-15 is powerful without being obvious
6. **Movement**: Use fly sparingly, speed is less detectable
7. **ESP**: Use tracers to predict enemy positions
8. **Stats**: Monitor your K/D to improve

### Bedwars Tips

1. **Bed ESP**: Always know where enemy beds are
2. **Resource Priority**: Focus on diamonds and emeralds
3. **Auto-Bridge**: Use safe mode when learning
4. **Defense**: Set alerts to 20-30 studs for good warning time
5. **Inventory**: Keep your hotbar organized
6. **Generators**: Check ESP for upgrade levels
7. **Speed Bridge**: Start with Normal mode, progress to Ninja/God
