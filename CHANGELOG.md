## Migration Guide: v4.0.0 ‚Üí v5.0.0

### **For Users:**
1. Just run the new loadstring - no migration needed!
2. Your settings won't transfer (old config system was broken anyway)
3. Key is still `123`
4. Toggle is still `Right Shift`

### **For Developers:**
If you forked the old version:

**Old Way (Broken):**
```lua
-- Required external modules that didn't exist
local Killaura = require(script.Parent.Modules.Killaura)

-- Buggy GUI with parent issues
local toggleFrame = self:CreateToggle(...)
toggleFrame.Parent = parent -- parent was often nil!
```

**New Way (Working):**
```lua
-- Self-contained module system
Modules.Killaura = {
    Enabled = false,
    Range = 20,
    -- All code is self-contained
}

-- Proper GUI with safe parenting
local toggleFrame = self:CreateToggle(..., parent)
-- Parent is passed as parameter and validated
```
