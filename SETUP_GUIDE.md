# ü¶¶ Otter Client v9.0.0 - Setup Guide

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Getting Started - 3 Easy Methods

---

## üìã METHOD 1: Direct Copy & Paste (EASIEST!)

### Steps:
1. **Open** `OtterClient.lua` in a text editor (Notepad, VS Code, etc.)
2. **Select All** (Ctrl+A or Cmd+A)
3. **Copy** (Ctrl+C or Cmd+C)
4. **Open your executor** (Xeno, Solara, KRNL, etc.)
5. **Paste** the code into the executor script box
6. **Execute!**
7. Enter key: `123`
8. Press `Right Shift` to toggle GUI

‚úÖ **This works immediately - No upload needed!**

---

## üîó METHOD 2: Using Pastebin (RECOMMENDED!)

### Steps:
1. Go to [pastebin.com](https://pastebin.com)
2. Open `OtterClient.lua` and copy all the code
3. Paste into Pastebin
4. Set these options:
   - Paste Name: `Otter Client v9.0.0`
   - Syntax Highlighting: `Lua`
   - Paste Expiration: `Never`
   - Paste Exposure: `Unlisted` or `Public`
5. Click **"Create New Paste"**
6. Click the **"raw"** button at the top
7. Copy that URL (should look like: `https://pastebin.com/raw/AbCdEfGh`)

### In Executor:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://pastebin.com/raw/YOUR_PASTE_ID"))()
```

Replace `YOUR_PASTE_ID` with your actual Pastebin raw URL!

‚úÖ **This gives you a short, easy-to-share link!**

---

## üì¶ METHOD 3: GitHub Upload (FOR SHARING!)

### Steps:

#### A. Create GitHub Repository:
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click **"New repository"**
3. Name it: `otter-client` (or anything you want)
4. Make it **Public**
5. Click **"Create repository"**

#### B. Upload Files:
1. Click **"uploading an existing file"**
2. Upload `OtterClient.lua`
3. Commit the file
4. **Optional:** Upload all other files too:
   - README.md
   - CHANGELOG.md
   - UPDATE_NOTES_v9.md
   - WHATS_NEW.md
   - LICENSE
   - etc.

#### C. Get Raw Link:
1. Click on `OtterClient.lua` in your repo
2. Click the **"Raw"** button
3. Copy that URL (looks like: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USERNAME/otter-client/main/OtterClient.lua`)

#### D. Use in Executor:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USERNAME/otter-client/main/OtterClient.lua"))()
```

Replace `USERNAME` with your GitHub username!

‚úÖ **This is the most professional option!**

## üí° Troubleshooting

### "HTTP Error Code: 404"
**Problem:** The URL doesn't exist

**Solutions:**
- Use Method 1 (Direct Copy & Paste)
- Upload to Pastebin (Method 2)
- Check your GitHub URL is correct

### "loadstring is not available"
**Problem:** Executor doesn't support loadstring

**Solution:**
- Use direct copy & paste method
- Try a different executor

### "Key is wrong"
**Problem:** Entered wrong key

**Solution:**
- The key is `123` (three numbers)
- Check for typos

### "Not whitelisted"
**Problem:** Your username isn't in the whitelist

**Solution:**
- Edit the whitelist in OtterClient.lua
- Find line 147-151 and add your username
- Or disable whitelist (line 144: `Enabled = false`)

### GUI doesn't show
**Problem:** CoreGui protection or parenting issue

**Solution:**
- Press `Right Shift` to toggle
- Check if your executor supports CoreGui
- Script falls back to PlayerGui automatically

### Settings don't save
**Problem:** Executor doesn't support file system

**Solutions:**
- Some executors don't have `writefile`/`readfile`
- Settings will reset on rejoin
- Use manual save in Utility tab when possible

## üîß Customization

### Change Whitelist:
Edit lines 144-150 in OtterClient.lua:

```lua
local WL = {
    Enabled = true,  -- Set to false to disable
    Users = {
        ["YourUsername"] = {premium = true, expires = nil},
        ["Friend1"] = {premium = false, expires = os.time() + 86400}
    },
    AdminKey = "YOUR_ADMIN_KEY"
}
```

### Change Key:
Edit line 663:

```lua
if box.Text == "123" then  -- Change to your key
```
